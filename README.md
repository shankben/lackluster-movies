# Lackluster Movies

Due to the rising popularity of 80's movies, nostalgic startup Lackluster Movies was born.

It began with a unique and compelling vision the founders quickly filed a provisional patent for: a brick-and-mortar store where customers enter into the warm embrace of popcorn and industrial carpet cleaner aroma, to lazily browse titles on real particle board shelves, and rent them for a small fee. No one else in history has ever thought of this.

They were excited to make their vision a reality, but in order to be successful, they needed a robust mainframe to handle the complex calculations and time-sensitive customer interactions in an automated fashion. How could they possibly contact their thousands of customers with a small staff of five employees to let them know that their rentals were due, let alone manage an exploding inventory of 80's movies?

This is the story of a startup. A really, _really_ original startup.
